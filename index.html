         <p class="box-one">Franz Kafka was a German-language writer from Prague, born in 1883 to a middle-class Jewish family. After studying law, he worked in insurance but dedicated his nights to writing, exploring themes of alienation, anxiety, and authority in works like The Metamorphosis and The Trial. His work wasn't widely recognized during his lifetime; he died of tuberculosis in 1924, and his fame grew posthumously when his friend Max Brod published his manuscripts against Kafka's wishes.</p>

    <strong><h2 class="title-two">Kafkaesque Meaning</h2></strong>
    <p class="box-two">Kafkaesque describes situations that are nightmarishly complex, absurd, and oppressive, often involving bewildering bureaucracy, illogical rules, and a sense of helplessness in the face of an impersonal authority. The term comes from the works of Franz Kafka (1883–1924), a Prague-born writer whose novels and stories—such as <em>The Trial</em>, <em>The Castle</em>, and <em></em>The Metamorphosis—depict</em> ordinary individuals trapped in surreal, labyrinthine systems where attempts to find clarity only deepen confusion. Although much of his work was published posthumously, Kafkas influence grew throughout the mid-20th century, and critics began using “Kafkaesque” to describe real-world situations that resemble the oppressive, dreamlike absurdity found in his fiction.</p>
